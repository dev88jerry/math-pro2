## Part 1
Enumeration input with the following: order, repetition, objects to chose, objects available

- [X] enumeration(0,0,7,11) 
- [X] enumeration(0,1,7,11)
- [X] enumeration(1,0,7,11) -Run time very long
- [X] enumeration(1,1,7,11) -Run time very long


## Part 2
Cryptarithme in base 11

Looking for a brute force program to generate all possible values

Rules:
1. A same letter will always be replaced by the same value
2. Different letters will have different values
3. The first letter can't be 0

To solve:

ROME + JACA + CANA = VILLE

Where A=1, B=10, E=8, G=0, ... as per rules above
